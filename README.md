# Erlang Handbook

Originally written by Bjarne Däcker and later revised by Robert Virding, the Erlang Handbook is a summary of the language features and the runtime system. It is aimed at people with some programming experience, serving as a quick introduction to the Erlang domain.

The handbook is typeset using LaTeX. If you want to build from source, the Makefile will be your friend. You will need the [minted] package (and [pygments]) for the syntax highlighting magic to work.
